### SUMO - 01 Overview

**S**imulation of **U**rban **MO**bility:  open source, highly portable, microscopic road traffic simulation package -> handle large road networks.   License: EPL

##### Regular and Extended Tools in SUMO Package

| Application Name      | Short Description                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SUMO                  | The microscopic simulation with no visualization; command line application |
| SUMO-GUI              | The microscopic simulation with a graphical user interface   |
| NETEDIT               | Network importer and generator; reads road networks from different formats and converts them into the SUMO-format |
| NETGENERATE           | Generates abstract networks for the SUMO-simulation          |
| DUAROUTER             | Computes fastest routes through the network, importing different types of demand description. Perform the DUA |
| JTRROUTER             | Computes routes using junction turning percentages           |
| DFROUTER              | Computes routes from induction loop measurements             |
| MAROUTER              | Performs macroscopic assignment                              |
| OD2TRIPS              | Decomposes O/D-matrices into single vehicle trips            |
| POLYCONVERT           | Imports points of interest and polygons from different formats and translates them into a description that may be visualized by SUMO-GUI |
| ACTIVITYGEN           | Generates a demand based on mobility wishes of a modeled population |
| EMISSIONSMAP          | Generates an emission map                                    |
| EMISSIONSDRIVINGCYCLE | Calculates emission values based on a given driving cycle    |
| Additional Tools      | There are some tasks for which writing a large application is not necessary. Several solutions for different problems may be covered by these tools. |
| **Extended tools**    | **Short Description**                                        |
| TraCI4Matlab          | A Matlab interface for connecting and extending information via TraCI Andres Acosta |
| TraaS                 | A SOAP (wbservice) interface for connecting and extending information via TraCI by Mario Krumnow, Also a Java TraCI client library. |
| LiSuM                 | LiSuM is a middleware that couples LISA+ and SUMO to execute real-world traffic control software within SUMO. |

##### Features

  * A fast openGL graphical user interface
  * Manages networks with several 10.000 edges (streets)
  * Fast execution speed (up to 100.000 vehicle updates/s on a 1GHz machine)
  * Interoperability with other application at run-time
  * Network-wide edge-based. vehicle-based, and detector-based outputs
  * Supports person-based inter-modal trips
* Network Import
  * Imports VISUM, Vissim, Shapefiles, OSM, RoboCup, MATsim, OpenDRIVE, and XML-Descriptions
  * Missing values are determined via heuristics
* Routing
  * Microscopic routes - each vehicle has an own one
  * Different Dynamic User Assignment algorithms
* High portability
  * Only standard C++ and portable libraries are used 
  * Packages for Windows main Linux distributions exist
